# 📽️ **Sakila Movie Rental – SQL + Python + Power BI Project (In Progress)**

### *(MySQL | SQL | Python | Pandas | Seaborn | Power BI | EDA)*

---

## 🚧 **Project Status: IN PROGRESS**

This project is currently **under development**.
SQL analysis, Python EDA, and Power BI visualization are being built step-by-step.

More updates will be added as the project progresses.

---

## 🧭 **Project Overview**

This project performs an end-to-end analysis of the **Sakila Movie Rental Database** using:

* **SQL** (data extraction + initial EDA)
* **Python** (data cleaning + deeper EDA)
* **Power BI** (dashboard visualization)

The goal is to analyze **store revenue**, **movie category demand**, **customer behavior**, **late rentals**, **staff performance**, and **inventory availability**.

---

## 🎯 **Project Objectives**

* Analyze store revenue trends over time
* Identify top customers and profitable movie categories
* Evaluate staff performance
* Understand rental duration and late return patterns
* Explore inventory availability per store
* Build a combined SQL + Python + Power BI analytics workflow

---

## 👥 **Stakeholders & Key Questions**

### Stakeholders

* **CEO / Business Manager** – revenue, growth, store performance
* **Marketing Team** – movie category demand, customer segments
* **Inventory / Operations** – late returns, stock levels
* **Data Team** – data reliability + KPI generation

### Key Questions

* Which stores generate the highest revenue?
* What film categories generate the most revenue?
* Who are the top 10 customers?
* Which movies are rented frequently or returned late?
* How efficient are staff members in processing rentals?
* How many movies are in stock vs out of stock?
* How can SQL, Python, and BI together improve insights?

# 🧩 **Project Workflow (Current Progress)**

### ✅ **Phase 1 — SQL Extraction & Initial Analysis (Started)**

* [x] Connected to Sakila DB
* [x] Basic SELECT queries
* [x] Joins between payment, rental, customer, store
* [ ] Revenue by store
* [ ] Revenue by movie category
* [ ] Late return analysis
* [ ] Customer-level revenue

### 🚧 **Phase 2 — Python EDA (In Progress)**

* [x] Export SQL query results to CSV
* [ ] Load into Pandas DataFrames
* [ ] Data cleaning & preprocessing
* [ ] EDA visualizations (heatmaps, histograms, barplots)
* [ ] Feature engineering (rental duration, late return flag, etc.)

### 🟡 **Phase 3 — Power BI Dashboard (Not Started Yet)**

Planned visuals:

* Total Revenue
* Revenue by Store
* Top 10 Customers
* Movie Category Revenue
* Late Returns Overview
* Staff Performance
* City & Country Revenue

---

# 📈 **Planned Final Insights (To Be Generated)**

*(Will be updated as analysis progresses)*

* Store 1 vs Store 2 revenue comparison
* Peak revenue months
* Most profitable categories (e.g., Sports, Sci-Fi, Family, etc.)
* Top 10 high-value customers
* Number of late returns
* Staff performance rankings
* Inventory in-stock vs out-of-stock

---

# 🧠 **Future Recommendations (Will Update After Completing Analysis)**

Expected recommendations will include:

* Marketing focus on high-demand movie categories
* Customer retention strategies for top renters
* Improving on-time return rates
* Optimizing inventory for high-demand films
* Staff scheduling based on demand patterns
